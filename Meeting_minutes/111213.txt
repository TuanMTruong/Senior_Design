Bronson's Update:
Bronson looked up a discrete bluettoh module that might work with 
our project. It is the Murata bluetooth module. At about 10x10mm it is the
size of a standard TQFP package. It will run at our voltage range of 0 to 3.3 volts.

- found a discrete bluetooth module 

Taks:
- looking to getting samples from suppliers (3 samples in case we break one)
- last look for other discrete modules before confirming an order on bluetooth samples

Garrett's update:
Garrett looked into sensors and found that most of the ones that used are disposable.
This is because ECG sensors make skin contacts and to maintain a clean environment each sensor
is thrown away after use. He managed to obtained some ECG skin pad sensors from the local 
hospital (with much difficulty). He has recommends we desgin our own sensor and has schematics
for it. Must look in to designing a sensor plane.

- went to the ER to get a sample ECK sensor
- looked in to re-usable sensor

tasks
- get in contact with people who wrote the sensor paper
- compose a list of question for the past ECK sensor design from OSU group
- look into what it takes for us to create a reliable sensor.

Tuan's updates:
Found a pwr management IC from TI that supplies a fixed voltage of 3.3v or 1.8v. Input of 3-4.7v
and is for li-ons batteries. The pwr management IC will supply a continuous current of 150mAs. 
With that in mind we talked about how much power each block with need. 

tasks:
- order pwr management IC
- finish project update by 13th
- order CC254 microcontroller
- contact former ECG project team for questions on their designs.
- contact supplier for E-ink display in hopes to get a sample.
