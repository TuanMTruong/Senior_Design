Today's meeting:
we got github set up

//These are the top level blocks the needs to be looked into
Design blocks:
- Power
- Sensor
- MCU
- Display
- wireless communication 


ARs:
Garrett - Sensor block
- I want 3 different design using PPG sensor
	-power consumption for each design
	- drawbacks 
	- benefits relative to our project
- ECG sensor designs
	- 3 different cources to get ECG sensor 
	- are there different types of ECG and how are they different
	- cost of ECG sensors vs PPG sensors
	- power of ECG vs PPG
	- compare acuracy
	- how to communicate with ECG
		- ex: if using a MCU do we use SPI, USART, or I2C
		- list 3 diffferent ECG sensor chip or ic
		- cost



Bronson - wireless communication
- Classic bluetooh vs Bluetooth LE
	- drawbacks and benefits relative to our project
- limitions to LE
- Communition protocols of LE
	- is it compatible older devices
		- which ones
- LE chips
	- pick which chip and how to communicate with it
	- cost
- variables to look into
	- size
	- cost
	- protocols
	- reliability
	- good documentations and sources
