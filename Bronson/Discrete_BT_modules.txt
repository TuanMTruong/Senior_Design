This is a list of the discrete bluetooth LE modules that I found in my research

	Price: $38.40
	Dimensions: 16x36 mm
	Serial Interface: UART
	Manufacturer Part #: CB-OLS426X-04-0
	Manufacturer: ConnectBlue 

Module: PAN1720

	Price: $14.36
	Dimensions: 14.5 mm x 8.2 mm x 3 mm
	Serial Interface: I2C
	Manufacturer Part #: ENW-89835A1KF
	Manufacturer: Panasonic 

Module: WS Bluetooth SMART Module
	
	Price: unkown, waiting on quote
	Dimensions: 10.4 x 7.7 x 1.8 mm 
	Serial Interface: UART
	Manufacturer Part #: LBCA2ZXWSE-TEMP 
	Manufacturer: Murata 


After looking through the different modules, the Panasonic module seems like the best option. The Murata module would be ideal but it seems unlikely that Murata is going to offer it as a single purchase or sample.
