3. check spi_sendarray using usart. check to see that each byte sends
	correctly/in correct order.
	-reviewed code. looks very similar to usart so I'm assuming it works.
	could verify this later with usart_sendbyte() if necessary.  
4. Measure VGH (should be > 12v) and VDH (should be > 8v)
5. Measure VGL (should be <-12v) and VDL (should be <-8v)
6. check data bytes and scan bytes in COG_write_fixed_line() using usart.



// - spi needs to be in mode 2 (CPOL =1, CPHA = 0)
